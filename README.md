This is my attempt to make the tic-tac-toe game in python. And trying to find the perfect solution, i.e. not lose at all, by useing a deep learning framework similar to GAN, see also Reference 2.

## Rules

A [Cyber Oculus web page](http://www.cyberoculus.com/tic-tac-toe.asp?Action=Rules) (Copyright 1998-2000) describes Tic-Tac-Toe as follows:

The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
