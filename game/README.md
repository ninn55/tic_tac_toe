# Game

This folder contains different versions of tic-tac-toe the game. It's mostly collected from internet, in order to avoid redundancy work. But I write some of it as a personal challenge.

## Environments

In order to run `play_core.py`, run the following command in any console. The code is tested in Anaconda3.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ninn55/tic_tac_toe
cd game
pip install -r requests.txt
python play_core.py
```
